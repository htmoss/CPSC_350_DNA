# DNA

Created a program to take an input of DNA strings consisting of C's, G's A's, and T's as nucleotides. It then calculates the total length, mean length, variance of length, and standard deviation of length of the DNA strings. Afterwards, it prints out 1000 new lines of DNA, based off of the probability of the input data already collected.
